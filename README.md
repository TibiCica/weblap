# Minecraft
This is a project of mine for ICT architectures. I decided to make a webpage about Minecraft because I considered it would be a rather liked topic among the students and Minecraft can be approached in many different ways, eo ipso it leaves a lot of space for creative solutions and new ideas and I can be flexible with that theme
