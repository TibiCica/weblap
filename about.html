                    <p>
                        <strong>Developer:</strong> Minecraft was created by Markus Persson, better known as <strong>Notch</strong>, 
                        a Swedish programmer who worked on the game in his free time.
                        <p>
                            <strong>Release:</strong> The first public version, <strong>Minecraft Classic</strong>, was released on May 17, 2009. 
                            It was a simple sandbox game where players could place and break blocks.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Inspiration:</strong> Notch was inspired by games like <em>Dwarf Fortress</em>, <em>Dungeon Keeper</em>, 
                            and <em>Infiniminer</em> to create a procedurally generated world where players had total freedom.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Alpha and Beta Phases:</strong>

                                    thanks to its limitless creativity and viral marketing via YouTube.</li>
